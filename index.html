    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a current student at Illinois Institute of Technology that is
      expected to graduate in Spring 2021, I have experiences in professional
      development leadership activities and in the customer service industry for
      several years. I am aspiring to a career that can develop my potential
      growth opportunities and looking forward to being part of a team that
      builds strong communication and technical skills as a foundation to
      support the company's brand and goals. In my free time, I like to enjoy
      music, watch movies and shows, and read books. I find it really relaxing
      to have some time to reflex with myself and discover interesting things
      that can motivate me in my life.
